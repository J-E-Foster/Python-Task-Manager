This project is a task management application for small business, that keeps a record of all users and tasks, and provides a platform for admin and other employees to assign, view, and manage tasks. It aims to simplify keeping track of who has to do what.

## How does it work?     

### All users can:
* Log into the system with a username and password.
* Assign tasks to themselves or other team members.
* View all tasks.
* View their own tasks.
* Edit tasks (change user or due date, or finalize task).

### Admin can:
* Register new users.
* View statistics.
* Generate statistical reports.

## Who can use it? 

Anyone  can use this free, open source software, although it is aimed at:
* Small to medium sized businesses that want to streamline their workflow.
* Team-working environments and large incremental projects.
* Remote-working environments where direct management isn't always possible.
* Beginner developers looking for something relatively simple to work with.
* Developers of similar systems looking for components.

We also welcome everyone who would like to continue improving this program!
