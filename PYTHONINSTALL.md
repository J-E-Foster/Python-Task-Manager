## How to run a program via IDLE

We need an [**IDE**](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide) to make programming easier. Python comes with its own one, **IDLE**:

* Search for the folder where you saved **task_manager.py** (or any other Python file).
* **Make sure the text files stored in the Text-files folder of this repository are stored in the same folder as task_manager.py.**
* Right click on the icon, and choose **"Edit with IDLE"**:

* The file should open. Click the **"Run"** tab and **"Run Module"**:

* You should now see the program running in the **IDLE** console:

And that's it - you're all set up!
