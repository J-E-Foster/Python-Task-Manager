We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards 

### Encouraged behaviour

* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

### Unacceptable behaviour

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement 
* Appropriate and fair corrective action will be taken in response to any behavior deemed 
  inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
* Any comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not in alignment with this Code of Conduct
  will be removed, edited, or rejected.
* Reasons for moderation  decisions will be communicated when appropriate.
